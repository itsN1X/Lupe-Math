## How to Run `.java` files!

Step 1: if you dont have it already, download the jdk (java devopment kit). 
You can find that here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html 
Make sure you download and install before moving to the next step. 

Step 2: next you'll have to download a program to compile the code, i use jgrasp. 
You can find that here: https://spider.eng.auburn.edu/user-cgi/grasp/grasp.pl?;dl=download_jgrasp.html 
When installing this program it should recognize thst you already have the jdk installed assuming step 1 was done correctly. 

Step 3: next you can download the code you want to run from github. 
Make sure you download the .java file and the picture in the repository folder. 
The .java file and the picture file must be in the same folder to work properly (leaving them both in the downloads folder is fine). 
Make sure when you download both files not to rename them, save them as written, a change in the name will cause them to not work properly. 

Step 4: load the .java file in the jgrasp program, you should see the code on your screen after you open it. 

Step 5: click the green plus button at the top of the screen about the code, 
this will compile the code and create a few .class files, the computer needs them to run the program. 
It should say operation complete at the bottom of the screen 1-3 seconds after clicking the green plus. 

Step 6: click the red running man button next to the green plus, this button will run the program.
